/* if we do the dropdown menu for the options we could do a hover and focus with it (.dropbtn:hover, .dropbtn:focus) 
We would obviously have to also color the button and have it change color on hover including the options inside the drop down 
and we would need a class for the js for it like .reveal {display:block;}
